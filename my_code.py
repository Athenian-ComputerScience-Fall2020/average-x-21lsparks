    #need to gather the numbers here, I proabably want the person to input each number individually 
    #because if they dont, then i need to separate them by commas and thats complicated
    #can I start a new function/variable? by combining two of them? for instance, 
    #I could do sum/len and call that average, and i could assign that the variable avg 
    #and I would need to do something where x, y, and z are substituted each time they do it with the inputs
    # so I need to do the f string
    # test your fucntion with this print statement before writing the input loop
    print(avg([x, y, z]))    # Put the values you want to test in for x,y and z

    # Now, comment out the print statement and work on the code below
    # Remember to indent in this section
    user_list = [] # start with an empty list
    # Write a loop to allow the user to input the values to be averaged
